# Hello    <img height="35" weight="70" src="https://i.ibb.co/NmcCZrz/Picture2.png">

In this section, I have put my small projects.
Many of these projects can be found on the internet, but I have written them in my own way

I hope they were helpful.


## üßÆ Python Calculator Project

This Python calculator project is designed to effortlessly handle your basic arithmetic operations. üßÆ By utilizing symbols such as '+', '-', 'x' (or '*'), and '/' (or '√∑'), users can input mathematical expressions and receive quick and accurate results. ‚ûó The program parses the input, extracts the numbers and the operation, and performs the calculation. üîÑ With error handling in place, it ensures a smooth user experience. üõ†Ô∏è Explore the world of Python programming with this handy calculator! üåê

## ü§≥üèª QRCode Generator

This Python code generates a QR code using the `qrcode` library. üêç You provide a website URL as input, and the code creates a QR code with specified effects such as box size and border. The QR code is then saved as an image, in this case as "qrcode.png".üì∑

> **Input:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ python qrcode_generator.py

```
>

> **Output:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ Enter URL: [user_input_here]
```

## üìñ Story Generator

This Python script creates a randomly generated story scenario. üìöüé≤ It features characters, settings, and plots, and combines them to form a unique narrative snippet. üêç Here's a breakdown:

Characters:

A list of fictional character names is defined, and one character is randomly chosen from this list.
Settings:

Various settings are provided, such as a forest, beach, city, etc. One setting is randomly selected.
Plots:

Different plot ideas are given, like searching for a lost artifact, solving a mystery, etc. A plot is randomly chosen.
Story Generation:

Using the selected character, setting, and plot, a sentence is constructed to describe a scenario. The characters "found themselves" in a specific setting, and engaged in a particular plot. The emotional state of the character is also randomly determined, with options like "excited," "scared," etc.

> **Input:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ python story_generator.py

```
>

> **Output:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ Charlie found themselves in a forest, escaping from danger. They were excited!
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Weather App

This Python script utilizes the OpenWeather API to provide weather information for a specified city and country. üåçüå¶Ô∏è The code prompts the user to input the city name and country code, then requests the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data. The temperature in degrees Celsius and a brief description of the weather (e.g., cloudy, sunny) are then extracted from the API response and presented to the user. ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è If the API request is unsuccessful, the script informs the user that weather information cannot be retrieved.

> **Input:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ python weather.py
Enter city name: Paris
Enter country code: FR
```
>

> **Output:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ The temperature is 20 degrees Celsius, and the weather is partly cloudy.
```
